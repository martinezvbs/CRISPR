# Description of Danny library
1. The library comes from Joung, J., et al. (2016) Nature protocols  DOI: 10.1038/nprot.2017.016
2. The protocol include a Python script to analyze the NGS results including the following steps:
    - Indel rates
3. Steps to run the script:
    - Download the script Supplementary Data 4
    - Install the required libraries (Python 2.7, biopython, SciPy)
    - Construct a sample sheet with each line corresponding to a separate sample and the following columns:
        - Sample name
        - .fastq or .fastq file name
        - Guide sequence
        - PCR target amplicon sequence
        - Experimental sample or control

4. To process all files in a single command line, the following command can be used:
    - python calculate_indel.py

5. For progressing individual samples, use the following command:
    - python calculate_indel.py -sample <sample_name>

6. The output of the script is a .csv file with the following columns:
    - Indels
    - counts of reads that matched perfectly
      - counts of reads that failed to align or were rejected because of low quality

7. See the full script named calculate_indel.py for more details

8. Danny shared the TF ORF library and the corresponding barcode, see the file 200102_tf_orf_library.xlsx

9. The file was renamed to tf_orf_library.xlsx, and it contains the following columns:
    - Name
    - RefSeq Gene Name
    - RefSeq and Gencode ID
    - Barcode Sequence
    - ORF sequence
    - Full sequence
    - Notes 1
    - Notes 2

10. General notes about the library
    - Each feature (gene) contain a specific barcode (name) and sequence of 24 nucleotides
    - The ORF sequence will vary between 300 and 3000 nucleotides
    - The FILE CONTAIN 1048576 rows and 8 columns
